This document describes the steps required to setup the AmplifyReality project.

1. Ensure the following are installed:
- Eclipse 
- EGit plugin for Eclipse
- Android SDK
- Android Developer Tools for Eclipse
- Android NDK (r7 or later)
- Visual Studio 2010 (Optional)

2. Setup Environment
- Download OpenCV 2.3.1 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-android/2.3.1/
- Extract the folder "OpenCV-2.3.1" to somewhere on your drive. 
- Create the windows environment variable "OPENCV_HOME", and point it to the OpenCV-2.3.1 folder. e.g. "C:\OpenCV-2.3.1"
- Create another windows environment variable "NDK_HOME", and point it to the Android NDK installation folder. e.g. "C:\Android-NDK-r7"
- In Eclipse, go to Window->Preferences. Under the Run-Debug item, select String Substitution. Add the two environment variables here, the same way they are defined above. 
- Import the OpenCV project from OPENCV_HOME. In the Android item of the project properties, set it as a library

3. Clone Repository and Setup Projects
- Put the following line on the clipboard (replace <username> with your username)
https://username@github.com/adamskubel/AmplifyReality.git
- Open the "Git Repositories" tab in Eclipse. If this tab is not visible, it can be added through Window->Show View.
- Right click and select "Paste Repository Path"
- Enter password, hit next
- Select on the "master" branch, and hit finish
- Wait for clone to complete
- Right click on repository in "Git Repositories" view, and click "Import Projects", select the AmplifyReality project
- Once the project is created, right click on it and open the properties. Go to the Android item, and add the OpenCV project as a dependency.

4. Editing, Building, and Deploying
- There is no CDT project because CDT sucks. Eclipse is only used for building and deploying.
- The project can be edited in Visual Studio by opening the project file in .../AmplifyReality/VisualStudio/
- If the environment variables were set correctly, all the includes should be found. There will still be some intellisense errors (for external files) but these can be ignored.
- To build, do a "Clean", with "Build immediately after" selected
- To deploy, right click and press "Run as Android application". Probably won't work on emulator, reliably tested only on HTC sensation at present. 

Logs:
- Logs are best read using "adb logcat", because the Eclipse log reader tends to get overfilled quickly. For example log filter strings, see LogDefinitions.h


Troubleshooting:
- If project crashes on startup and/or some library errors are seen in the logs, then OpenCV libraries are probably missing. Make sure that the OpenCV project is in Eclipse and configured as a library, and make sure the AmplifyReality project has a reference to it.
